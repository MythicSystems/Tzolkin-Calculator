Tzolkin Calculator
===========

v2.3

The Tzolkin Calculator is a Flash/Actionscript application that enables the placement of a simple, interactive Tzolkin time calculator into any website. The Tzolkin Calculator converts standard (Gregorian) calendar time to Tzolkin (Mayan) calendar time glyphs (based on DreamSpell conversions). Choose a date, and then calculate to get the ancient equivalent.

Integrates easily into any website.  No coding required. Loads quickly. The stand-alone desktop version (also included for Mac, Windows, and Linux) is also great as a quick and handy reference to Tzolkin calendar time.

NOTE : Currently, glyph calculation is not accurate because original programming was configured only up to 2013.  A simple fix for dates beyond 2013 will be applied soon.
